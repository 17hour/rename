                <h4>I am putting this here woohoo</h4>
            <p> So Lit Mobile just sent me this solar wireless battery pack, I'm excited. Let's see what's inside.

                I really like the build quality. It's got hand grips on the side, it's shockproof and water-resistant.
                
                The power bank has 20,000 milliamps, which can fully charge your phone up to eight times.
                
                It's also got a convenient loop for carabiners.
                
                On the back of the device, we have a bunch of solar panels which can charge the battery bank in about 60 minutes.
                
                On the top of the device, there are three USB ports and two of them are fast chargers.
                
                If you hit the power button two times, the LED light comes on.
                
                If you hit the power button once, the LED lights will tell you how much battery you have.
                
                There's a micro-USB port on the side for fast charging.
                
                My favorite part of this device is that it charges my phone wirelessly.
                
                There's a red light indicator at the top to let you know that your phone is charging.</p>
